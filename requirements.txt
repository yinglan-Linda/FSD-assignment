Four main menus: 
University System - Lets users switch between Student and Admin systems - Everyone
Student System - Register / Login (with Regex validation for email and password) - Students
Subject Enrolment System - Enroll, Remove, View Subjects, Change Password - Logged-in Students
Admin System - Show all students, Group or Sort them, Remove or Clear data - Admin Only

Rules:
Naming: 
    Classes: use PascalCase (e.g. UserLogin, UniSystemEntry) 
    Private constants or attributes inside a class start with an underscore (e.g. _adminName: "Jone Smith" )
Comments:
    Every module, class, and function must have a docstring before its definition, including:
        A one-line summary of what the function or what the code does,
        a short explanation after code line to show the parameters and return values. (optional)
Git:
    Before submit the code, each member creates their own branch locally.
    Use small, clear commits to explain what was changed.
    Merges the branches after team reviews.
